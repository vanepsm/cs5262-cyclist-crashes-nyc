        "# Investigating cyclist accidents in New York City\n",
        "## Background\n",
        "### Introduction\n",
        "**The objective of this project is to identify factors contributing to cyclist injuries and fatalities.**\n",
        "\n",
        "With the increasing popularity of bicycles and e-bikes, it's imperative for drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, and policymakers to recognize the risks associated with cyclists sharing the road and take appropriate measures.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Description\n",
        "### Topic\n",
        "Our topic will focus on motor vehicle crashes that involve cyclist injuries or deaths, and attempt to analyze these data to determine what factors are correlated with these events.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data\n",
        "This project seeks to gain insights into vehicle accidents involving cyclists extracted from the New York City vehicle collisions dataset.\n",
        ">> https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-crashes\n",
        "\n",
        "A subset of the data pertaining only to cyclist accidents has been extracted and is available here:\n",
        ">> https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CFaRXe3Y6PWHpYOoGD7qih6-1oWzUi0e/view\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Data sub-selection criteria\n",
        "The original data set contains over two million rows, and encapsulates a broad spectrum of vehicle collisions. In order to narrow this dataset down the following was done:\n",
        "- Import the original CSV data to a relational database for refinement.\n",
        "- Idenify a subset of rows:\n",
        " - Include only the rows with cyclist injuries or fatalities\n",
        " - Remove all rows with more than 3 vehicles involved in the crash\n",
        " - Remove all rows with a null or empty zip code\n",
        "- Identify a subset of columns:\n",
        " - Exclude all columns with details about a 4th or 5th vehicle\n",
        " - Exclude duplicate latitude/longitude columns\n",
        "- Export the subset data to a new CSV for use in this project.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Performance Metrics\n",
        "\n",
        "### Binary Classification\n",
        "- **Injured vs. Killed.** I would like to classify observations into two classes. \"Cyclist Injured\" vs \"Cyclist Killed\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Clustering\n",
        "I am hoping to extract meaningful patterns from these data, some of which may include:\n",
        "- **Physical location.** Intuitively there are locations that are more dangerous for cyclists than others. Intersections, curves, congested spaces, etc...\n",
        "- **Time.** It seems likely that certain times will see more accidents than others.\n",
        "- **Types of vehicles involved.** It's possible that certain vehicle types will result in more accidents overall, or perhaps result in death more often than injury.\n",
        "- **Contributing factors for the accident.** What types of contributing factors are more likely to result in injury or death? Distracted driving, improper use of passing lanes or alcohol intoxication?"
