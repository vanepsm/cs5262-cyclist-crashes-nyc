        "\n",
        "The [National Safety Council](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/safety-topics/bicycle-deaths/) reports a 37% increase in preventable cycling deaths over the past decade, making up 2% of all motor vehicle fatalities. Understanding the factors contributing to these incidents is crucial for reducing cyclist deaths and injuries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, [e-bikes are gaining popularity as low cost / low carbon transport systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198221000543), surpassing sales of electric cars. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/business/e-bikes-urban-transit.html), [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/e-bike-popularity-is-surging-creating-regulatory-challenges-on-u-s-roads) and many other publications have highlighted the rise of e-bikes and the accompanying safety challenges. This new wave of cyclists introduces distinct dynamics on the roads as they take ownership of vehicles with higher top speeds and greater ranges.\n",
        "\n",
        "The increasing accidents involving motor vehicles and cyclists present a growing problem worldwide. As transportation solutions evolve, it's essential to gain insights into these trends to effectively address the emerging challenges.\n"

        "Motor vehicle accidents are complicated events, and accidents between motor vehicles and bicycles are more complex yet. Many data points that we wish we knew about cyclist fatalities are not known. Was the cyclist riding on the road, sidewalk or bike lane? Was the cyclist wearing a helmet? Were there adverse weather conditions present? None of these data points are reported in the New York City vehicle collision dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other data elements that do exist, like contributing factors to the accident or vehicle types, have dozens (maybe hundreds) of possible values.  How can we analyze the data in a way that teases the signal from the noise? I'm hoping this project can help do just that."

By training data models on this dataset I hope to learn patterns, relationships and structures from the data. I also hope to be able to enhance decision making for cyclists, motorists and policymakers.\n",

        "- **Trucks are more deadly than cars.** I own a large truck now, and I believe them to be more dangerous than cars I've owned in the past.  Visibility is limited, they have much greater mass, and the height of a truck ought to hit a cyclist full on, rather than the \"up and over\" type of glancing impact of a car. If this prediction is true then the liklihood of death instead of injury with a truck involved in the accident will be much greater than other vehicles.\n",
        "- **E-bikes are less dangerous than bikes.** Of all my predictions, this is the one I'm least certain about. E-bikes require less exhertion, and the rider is more often in an upright position.  Which should allow the rider to be more observant of his environment. I believe e-bike accidents will have fewer fatalities by percentage than standard bicycles.\n",
        "- **Distracted driving kills.** I expect the various forms of distracted driving (cell phones, headphones, etc...) will outweight all other causes for both injury and death."

        "- Idenify a subset of rows:\n",
        " - Include only the rows with cyclist injuries or fatalities\n",
