        "\n",
        "The [National Safety Council](https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/safety-topics/bicycle-deaths/) reports a 37% increase in preventable cycling deaths over the past decade, making up 2% of all motor vehicle fatalities. Understanding the factors contributing to these incidents is crucial for reducing cyclist deaths and injuries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, e-bikes are gaining popularity, surpassing sales of electric cars. The [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/business/e-bikes-urban-transit.html), [PBS](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/e-bike-popularity-is-surging-creating-regulatory-challenges-on-u-s-roads) and many other publications have highlighted the rise of e-bikes and the accompanying safety challenges. This new wave of cyclists introduces distinct dynamics on the roads.\n",
        "\n",
        "The increasing accidents involving motor vehicles and cyclists present a growing problem worldwide. As transportation solutions evolve, it's essential to gain insights into these trends to effectively address the emerging challenges.\n"

        "Motor vehicle accidents are complicated events, and accidents between motor vehicles and bicycles are more complex yet. Many data points that we wish we knew about cyclist fatalities are not known. Was the cyclist riding on the road, sidewalk or bike lane? Was the cyclist wearing a helmet? Were there adverse weather conditions present? None of these data points are reported in the New York City vehicle collision dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Other data elements that do exist, like contributing factors to the accident or vehicle types, have dozens (maybe hundreds) of possible values.  How can we analyze the data in a way that teases the signal from the noise? I'm hoping this project can help do just that."
